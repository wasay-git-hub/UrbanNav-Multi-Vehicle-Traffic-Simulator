# UrbanNav-Multi-Vehicle-Traffic-Simulator
This is a **Multi-Vehicle Traffic Simulation System** that simulates realistic urban traffic patterns using advanced pathfinding algorithms (A*), physics-based vehicle movement, and dynamic congestion analysis. The system provides real-time visualization of traffic flow with support for multiple vehicle types, traffic incidents, and road blockages.
